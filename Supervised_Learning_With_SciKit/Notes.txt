What is Machine Learning?
 - Giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data.
 - without being explicitly programmed.

 Ex: 
 - Learning to predict whether an email is spam or not
 - Clustering wikipedia entries into different categories

 Types:

 Supervised Learning : Uses labedled data
 Unsupervised learning : Uses unlabled data

 Reinforcement learning 
 - Software agents interacts with an environment 
    * Learn how to optimize their behavior
    * Given a system of rewards and punishments
    * Draws inspiration from behavioural psychology
- Applications
    * Economics
    * Genetics
    * Game playing

  Naming conventions : 
    * Feature = predictor variables = independent variables
    * Target variable = dependent variable = response variable

Goal of Supervised learning : 

- To learn from data to make predicts on new data
